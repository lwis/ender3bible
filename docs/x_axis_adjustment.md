# X-Axis Levelling

1. Unplug the printer and then disconnect the Z-Axis stepper (this will keep any generated current from damaging the board or stepper drivers).

2. Move the hotend to the center of the gantry to create an even weight distribution.

3. Rotate the Z-Axis coupler until there is 10CM between X-Axis gantry and top of the printer on the left side (it doesn't matter which side you place at 10CM, it is just for reference).

4. Measure from the 2020 extrusion on the X-Axis bar to the 2020 extrusion on the top frame (not between mounting brackets) on both the left and right side.

5. Write the measurements down and note which way the X-Axis bar is tilted.Â Typically the right side is sagging (low).

6. Loosen the yellow wheels by turning the eccentric nuts, only loosen them enough so they turn freely. The eccentric nuts can be turned either way, so just need to adjust a bit and feel if the wheels are getting lose or tight, it should not take more than 1/2 turn to see some change.

7. Loosen the wheels in green in the pic below, and if you still cannot level the X-Axis bar, then loosen the bottom purple wheel also.

8. Lift the right side of the X-Axis bar so it is level, if possible clamp it, or prop something under the bar, or hold it - both sides should now measure the same 10CM distance from the top 2020 extrusion (X-Axis bar is now parallel to the top 2020 extrusion).

9. Tighten the bottom green wheel on the right side, then the bottom purple wheel on the left side (if loosened), and then the top green wheel on the right side.

10. Re-adjust the yellow eccentric wheels to snug them down, adjust them so you can turn them with your fingers but not easily.

11. Verify all wheels are tightened and you're able to turn them using your fingers (but again, they are not easily turned).

12. Re-measure the parallelness of the X-Axis bar and the top 2020 extrusion by repeating #2, then make any adjustments again.

13. Once done, re-connect the Z-Axis stepper and verify that all the steppers and end stops remain connected.

A note on the eccentric nuts; they can be loosened without loosening the locknut, they should turn a bit with the included wrench. The eccentric nuts have a hole that is not centered, so when they are rotated, they move the bolt that goes through them, this enables the adjustment of the wheels in or out by turning the eccentric nuts.
